GreenCastalia is an extension for Castalia that allows to model and simulate networks of embedded devices with energy-harvesting capabilities.

The main features of GreenCastalia are:

* support for multiple energy sources and multi-source harvesters;
* support for networks of embedded devices with heterogeneous harvesting and storage capabilities;
* support for multi-storage architectures consisting of a combination of disposable batteries, supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries;
* support for non-ideal battery models based on empirical discharge patterns and of supercapacitor leakage models;
* support for energy prediction models.
